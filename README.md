# aws-walkthrough

Alwatys pick a region that is closest to one while creating an S3 bucket. 

ACL's (access control lists) are set of rules on who has what permissions on what resource. Also it allows one to decdie who controls nd can do what with objects into a buket.

Enables ACL.

Also to host a public website, pulic access cannot be blcocked. If bocked you can;t host and provides warning if blocked. 

Now uploading website content to our bucket. 

Dowload all files needed which can include of an HTML file that sets up website. Zip file with all images and then upload them onto S3 bukcket

After uploading, now we will host a website using static website hosting. Even though HTML file is completed it is only local, now lets make it globaly found on the internet.

After going through and doing static hosting, now the issue is making the files public. Right now the file is denied and forbidden.

In my Step process tabs I will have screenshots attatched going step by step into how I completed this project.
